1.In the render core set the proper directory, at which the safefile you want to preview is located. It is important for the render core to have an initialy valid save file upon starting, otherwise unexpected behavior might occur. Later on the save files can be realoaded right in the application without any problems. Note that project uses relative directores, keep that in mids.

2.To focus on a text field click on it in the app and input correct file name, without spicifying the extention, simply omit it.
