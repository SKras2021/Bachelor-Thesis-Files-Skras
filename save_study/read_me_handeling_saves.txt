Zip was to heavy for GitHub > 100 MB so
To rebuild save file 
cat \[2500TurnsExample\]temp_saves2_part_* > \[2500TurnsExample\]temp_saves2.zip 

Windows (NOT TESTED)
copy /b "[2500TurnsExample]temp_saves2_part_*" "[2500TurnsExample]temp_saves2.zip"

Or just use temp_saves from folder. Do not forget to rename folder to temp_saves2 if you intend of using the visualisator or change the folder name there.

NOTE COULD NOT UPLOAD ALL THE TRIALS, since project would > 1GB and many > 100MB as individsual file sizes.
